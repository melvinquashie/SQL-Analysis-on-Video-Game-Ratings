He envisions his complete dungeon to be one so appealing as to lure the legendary Wandering Demon. Defeating this menacing monster would free the townspeople from the fear he casts upon them, while winning acclaim as a true dungeon maker for the ""Architect."" The townspeople are initially skeptical about the Architect's ability to achieve his ultimate goal of building such a dungeon. Over the years, they've watched other such dungeon makers arrive with great plans but ultimately fail -- falling prey to the very monsters they've lured into their dungeons or haphazardly abandoning their creations. However, as the Architect's dungeon grows and improves, luring rarer and more powerful enemies, and he begins bringing back more valuable treasures, the townspeople begin offering support to his mission. Soon the whole town is involved in the dungeon making process; they give advice about the intricacies of dungeon making, sell crucial items, provide weapons and magic spells, treat the Architect when injured, and request various favors to be completed in the expanding dungeon in exchange for generous rewards. Whether the growing hopes of the townspeople and the Architect will be realized all depends on the quality of the dungeon he creates and his developing battle skills. Design and modify a customizable dungeon, floor-by-floor, using simple controls to quickly develop a deep and detailed dungeon. Strategically layout and improve your dungeon to maximize its attractiveness and lure in the most sought-after enemies to take their loot.
