After playing a few levels and learning the basics of your microscopic world, you begin to unlock additional modes of play and the ability to choose the number of tentacles on your rotozoan. Each mode has its own specific purpose: reach a particular length with your tentacles or grow them to the greatest length possible.

There's just one catch: Successfully absorbing a goobug depends on matching its color to your tentacle. Also, longer tentacles can more easily come in contact with incorrectly colored goobugs (causing damage to the tentacle and decreasing your life force), and the goobugs themselves multiply and begin adapting to your movement. Luckily, objects such as the restorative heart item and special attack-enabling cyclone item can be found floating in the ooze to help your rotozoan survive. With atmospheres ranging from peaceful to intensely challenging, Art Style: Rotozoa offers a wide variety of levels.
